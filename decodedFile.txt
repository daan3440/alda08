(from "Purple Rain" soundtrack)

[Spoken Intro - Lisa Coleman and Wendy Melvoin:]
Wendy?
Yes, Lisa?
Is the water warm enough?
Yes, Lisa
Shall we begin?
Yes, Lisa

[Prince:]
Where is my love life?
Where can it be?
There must be something wrong with the machinery
Where is my love life?
Tell me, where has it gone?
Somebody please please tell me what the hell is wrong

Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue
Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue

Oh

Where is my baby?
Where can she be?
Somebody please, please tell me what is wrong with me?
Where is my baby?
Tell me, where has she gone?
Somebody please, please tell me what the hell is wrong?

Ooh

Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue
Till I find the righteous one
Computer blue

[Solo]

[Ad lib:]
The computer's on the verge of breakdown!
Come on
Aw baby, don't make me

[Spoken Interlude - Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman:]
Poor lonely computer
It's time someone programmed you
It's time you learned love and lust
They both have four letters
But they're entirely different words
Poor lonely computer
Poor, poor lonely computer
Do you really know what love is?

[Prince:]
(Na, na, na, na, na)
Wave your hands in the air
Now everybody sing it (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out
Work out, work out (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out
Work out, work out (Na, na, na, na, na)
Everybody work out

[Spoken Interlude - Prince:]
He didn't like living home alone
The house where he lived had many hallways
It was a long walk to his bedroom
Because to him each hallway represented an emotion
Every one vastly different from the next
One day while she was with him he decided to name each one of them
She was at his side, one hand on his thigh
No, wait
She was sort of half a step behind him
Yeah
The grip on his thigh intensified as they walked slowly through the corridor
He named the hallway "Lust"
And as they passed thru the next one
He named it "Fear"
The grip she now loosened so he walked faster
Her hands now trembling
She let drop to her side as he wrote the word "Insecurity"
He looked n her eyes and smiled a demon smile
And quickly walked on to the next
Corridor after corridor he named almost all when suddenly
He stopped
He picked up the word "Hate"
She was gone
So he picked up the last one
"Pain"

[Solo]

[Ad lib - Prince:]
On the verge of a breakdown
What is life without love?
It's hell Computer Blue!

[Prince:]
Father, Father, the sun is gone
(Father, Father) The dawn, the dawn
Father, Father, where is the dawn?
(Where is the dawn, Father?)
Na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na (Na, na, na, na, na)

Shall I go to church on Sundays?
Shall I stay home and pray?
Shall I try to make her happy?
Shall I try to make her stay?

[Spoken Interlude - Wendy Melvoin & Lisa Coleman (Prince):]
Narrow-minded computer
(Somebody please, please tell me)
It's time someone programmed you
(Somebody please, please tell me what's wrong with me)
It's time you learned women are not butterflies
They're computers too
Just like you Computer Blue
(Where is my baby?)
Chauvinistic computer
It's time someone programmed you
(Na, na, na, na, na)
You fall n love too fast and hate too soon
And take for granted the feeling's mutual
(The feeling's mutual!)
We're computers too
Just like you Computer Blue
